Usage: ./solver <options> --input=<file>
	--input=<file>         File in CPF format [REQUIRED]
Options:
	--min-makespan=<value> Minimum makespan researched
	--max-makespan=<value> Maximum makespan researched
	--max-time=<value>     Maximum amount of seconds to solve the CPF
	--trust                Don't verify that a solution exists (This can be useful as the algorithm used for that is incomplete)
	--no-mdd               Don't reduce search space
	--output=<file>        Write path of all agents to <file>, each line is a path, each path is a sequence of number representing nodes
