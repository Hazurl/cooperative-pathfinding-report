# CPF Solver

This report was developped during my last year of bachelor.
The goal was to model a cooperative pathfinding problem into a satisfiability problem and to find a method to get
the optimal solution.
This research focused on the DIRECT encoding, improved by using a MDD. 

## Organization

The report can be found at the root, unfortunately it's in french, but the ressources used and located at the end of it are in english.
The implementation is located in the folder `impl`, a README can be found with the instruction to build it.
